**Experiment-6**

**Title**

**Implementation of if-else Conditional Statements in Python**

**Aim**

To study and implement conditional control structures in Python and perform various decision-making operations.

**Objectives**

- To understand the concept of conditional logic 

- To perform basic if-else statement implementation 

- To apply nested if-else and if-elif-else ladders 

- To understand logical operators within conditions 

- To perform data validation using conditions 

**Theory**

Conditional statements in Python are used to execute a specific block of code based on whether a condition evaluates to True or False. These statements allow the program to make decisions and control the flow of execution. Unlike sets or dictionaries, which are data structures, conditional statements are control structures.

**Characteristics of if-else**

- **Decision Based:** Execution depends on Boolean logic.

- **Indentation Sensitive:** Python uses indentation to define the scope of the code block.

- **Mutually Exclusive:** In an if-else structure, only one block of code is executed.

- **Flexible:** Can handle multiple conditions using elif (else-if).

**Conditional Operations**

- Simple if: Executes code only if the condition is true.

- if-else: Provides an alternative path if the condition is false.

- if-elif-else: Checks multiple expressions sequentially.

- Nested if: An if statement inside another if statement.

**Conclusion**

Conditional statements efficiently handle decision-making processes, allowing programs to react dynamically to different inputs. They are essential for controlling program flow and implementing complex logic in real-world applications.
